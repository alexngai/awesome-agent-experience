# Agent Search Optimization & Generative Engine Optimization

## Agent Search Optimization (ASO)

ASO is the practice of optimizing content, data, and online presence to be discovered, understood, and acted upon by AI-powered search agents (ChatGPT, Google AI Overviews, Perplexity, Claude). The term is used interchangeably with "Search Agent Optimization" (SAO) and "Agentic AI Optimization" (AAIO).

**The core shift:** SEO optimized for clicks from search engine results pages. ASO optimizes for citations within AI-generated responses. LLMs typically cite only 2-7 domains per response, far fewer than Google's traditional "10 blue links."

### Key Statistics

- AI-referred web sessions jumped **527%** between January and May 2025
- DMG Media reported an **89% decline** in click-through rates in July 2025
- Gartner predicts traditional search volume will drop **25% by 2026**
- **60%** of Google searches are now zero-click
- Webflow reports **8%** of signups from LLM traffic, converting at **6x** rate of Google Search
- IDC predicts brands will allocate **5x more budget** to LLM optimization vs SEO by 2029

## Agent Experience (AX) as a Discipline

AX was popularized by **Matt Biilmann**, CEO of Netlify, who coined the term to describe "the holistic experience AI agents have when interacting with a product, platform, or system."

### Evolutionary Arc

- **1993:** Don Norman coins "User Experience" (UX)
- **2011:** Jeremiah Lee coins "Developer Experience" (DX)
- **2024-2025:** Matt Biilmann coins "Agent Experience" (AX)

### Core AX Principles

1. Agents don't scan visual hierarchies -- they parse data, weight probabilistic relationships, and follow explicit instructions
2. Agents need: structured data, clear APIs, logical task flows, machine-readable documentation
3. Agents are first-class citizens of the digital ecosystem, serving as delegates of end users
4. Poorly designed AX = user pain (when agents fail, the human suffers)
5. Access parity: APIs exposed to agents should match what's available through browsers/apps

### Industry Traction

- BVP (Bessemer Venture Partners) named AX as their Law #1 in AI Developer laws
- Sequoia's Sonya Huang: "we are going from the age of product-led growth to the age of agent-led growth"
- Only **24%** of respondents design APIs with AI agents in mind (Postman survey)
- **60%** design "for humans only"
- Salesforce CEO predicts over **1 billion AI agents** by end of fiscal year 2026

## Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)

GEO is the most **academically grounded** term, originating from a Princeton University research paper (KDD 2024). It refers to optimizing content to appear as sources and citations in AI-generated responses.

### GEO vs SEO

- SEO optimizes for clicks from SERPs
- GEO optimizes for citations within AI-generated responses
- Citation authority replaces backlinks
- Structured data outweighs SERP snippets

### Core GEO Strategies

1. Structure content with direct answers in the first 40-60 words
2. Maintain fact density with statistics every 150-200 words
3. Cite authoritative sources throughout
4. Implement proper schema markup
5. E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) remains critical
6. Platform-specific tactics: ChatGPT favors encyclopedic content, Perplexity rewards recency, Google AI Overviews prioritize existing top-ranking content

## LLM SEO

LLM SEO is the practice of optimizing content so it appears in AI responses generated by tools like ChatGPT and Google AI Overviews.

### Key Strategies

1. Structure content for machine readability (clear sentences, no metaphors/digressions)
2. Create original, expert-driven content (LLMs deprioritize repackaged information)
3. Focus on entity optimization over keyword optimization
4. Optimize for "chunked" content -- short, logically complete ideas
5. Implement schema markup for context and structure

### Key Insight

The terminology debate is largely settled: GEO, AEO (Answer Engine Optimization), LLMO (LLM Optimization), and LLM SEO are treated as effectively synonymous. See [terminology.md](terminology.md) for a full mapping.

## Relationship Between Traditional SEO and Agent Optimization

The consensus is that traditional SEO and agent optimization are **converging, not replacing each other**.

- Traditional SEO focused on **visibility**; AI SEO is about **eligibility** (being eligible to be cited)
- "SEO" is being redefined as "Search Everywhere Optimization" -- Google, YouTube, TikTok, Reddit, AI citations, agentic commerce
- **The Great Decoupling:** more impressions but fewer clicks. Only 40.3% of U.S. Google searches resulted in an organic click in March 2025
- Yet conversions often increase due to higher-intent traffic from LLM referrals
- Authority, relevance, and trust remain central -- AI systems rely entirely on human-made web content
