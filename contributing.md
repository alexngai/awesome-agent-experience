## Adding a New Item

Please ensure your submission meets the following criteria:

- **Directly related** to Agent Experience (AX) — making systems accessible and usable by AI agents.
- **Quality** — Well-maintained projects, well-argued articles, credible sources.
- **Not already listed** — Check the README first to avoid duplicates.

### For GitHub Projects

- Meaningful adoption (stars, forks, or known users).
- Active repository (commits in the last 3 months for tools, or established for standards).
- Substantive README and project description.

### For Articles

- Original insights, not summaries of other articles.
- Include the author and their affiliation.
- Prioritize pieces that propose frameworks, share data, or document real implementations.
